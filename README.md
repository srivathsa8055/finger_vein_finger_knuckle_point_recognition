## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on biometric authentication using **finger vein** and **knuckle print** patterns. Both these modalities provide unique and secure identifiers for use in:
- Banking and secure financial transactions
- Forensic and criminal identification
- High-security access control systems

The repository includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Image visualization
- Feature extraction
- Optional: Machine Learning-based classification

### 📈 Feature Extraction

- Texture features
- Edge detection (e.g., Canny, Sobel)
- Statistical analysis (mean, variance)

### 🧠 Classification (Optional)

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Potential Deep Learning with CNNs for future work
