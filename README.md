# Finger Vein & Knuckle Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on biometric analysis using finger vein and knuckle patterns. The objective is to process, analyze, and potentially classify finger vein and knuckle images for biometric authentication.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `finger_vein_kuckle_project_n.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store input images or datasets if you have one.

## ⚙️ Features

- Image processing and enhancement techniques for finger vein and knuckle images.
- Feature extraction for biometric patterns.
- Visualization of processed outputs.
- Potential ML classification workflow (if applicable).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with these libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
